### In this problem we need to compare the two halves of the linked-list so we can find if they are the same
### to get the the two halves we

1. Get the mid-point of the linked-list through having two pointer and incrementing one by 2 and the other by 1
2. Reverse the mid-point linked-list so you can start from the end
3. compare the reversed linked-list with the original and stop at the middle so you can avoid any loops
